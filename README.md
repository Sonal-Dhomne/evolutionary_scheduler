# Evolutionary Timetable Scheduling

This project uses a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to solve the complex problem of timetable scheduling — assigning classes to timeslots, rooms, and professors without conflicts. It is especially useful for educational institutions needing an efficient, flexible way to manage course schedules under multiple constraints.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📅 Generates weekly class timetables automatically.
- 🧬 Uses genetic algorithm principles: selection, crossover, mutation.
- ✅ Enforces hard constraints like:
  - No overlapping classes for students or professors
  - Room capacity limits
  - Timeslot conflicts
- 💡 Supports soft constraints and can be extended further.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Initialization**: A population of random schedules is created.
2. **Fitness Evaluation**: Each schedule is scored based on how well it meets the constraints.
3. **Selection**: The best-performing schedules are chosen to create the next generation.
4. **Crossover & Mutation**: Genetic operations introduce variation.
5. **Evolution**: The process repeats for several generations until an optimal or satisfactory schedule is found.
